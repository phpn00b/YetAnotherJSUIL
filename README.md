# YetAnotherJSUIL
Yet another JavaScript library for building user interfaces

# Goals 
* Only use JavaScript, CSS, HTML. No requirement for any other lib.
* No need to compile, transpile, pack, webpack, or otherwise prepare code base to run (though no reason why you couldn't if you wanted to)
* No automagically complex features that would be difficult for anyone past a intermediate programmer to understand with a 5 minute explination.
* Reusable Code.
* Be easily usable as a rapid prototyping framework as well as well designed enough to finish the production app with. 
* Native support for concepts like data binding as well as the MVVM pattern.
* Design a framwork that does what you expect in a straight forward way.
* Avoid complex interaction patterns.
* Write less code but get more done.
* Use tools (ie I need to make them for you) to work smarter.
