# YetAnotherJSUIL

Yet another JavaScript library for building user interfaces

# Concept

A Javascript framework that uses an oriented approach with JavaScript classes. Each node instance is in charge if its own state. When something in it changes you tell the framwork to invalidate the object and it redraws itself.

# Goals

- Only use JavaScript, CSS, HTML. No requirement for any other lib.
- No need to compile, transpile, pack, webpack, or otherwise prepare code base to run (though no reason why you couldn't if you wanted to)
- No automagically complex features that would be difficult for anyone past a intermediate programmer to understand with a 5 minute explanation.
- Reusable Code.
- Be easily usable as a rapid prototyping framework as well as well-designed enough to finish the production app with.
- Native support for concepts like data binding as well as the MVVM pattern.
- Design a framework that does what you expect in a straightforward way.
- Avoid complex interaction patterns.
- Write less code but get more done.
- Use tools (i.e., I need to make them for you) to work smarter.

This is a work in progress. Some day it might be great... Today it might be a dumpster fire.
